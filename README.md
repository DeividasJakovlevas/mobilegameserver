# mobile game server

This project is a Java Spring-based application designed to provide a backend infrastructure for a mobile game. 
The application currently allows users to create or retrieve players based on an authentication token and add characters to the plater. 

The project makes use of the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern to provide separation of concerns and maintainable code. 
The application includes a RESTful API, which provides endpoints for client-side applications to interact with the server.

The project is made to demonstrate proficiency in Java Spring and RESTful API design and also to maybe be used for an actual project in the future.
